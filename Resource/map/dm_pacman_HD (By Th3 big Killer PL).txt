-=[What is the pacman?]=-

Pac-Man is an arcade game developed by Namco and licensed for distribution in the United States by Midway,
first released in Japan on May 22, 1980. Immensely popular from its original release to the present day,
Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games,
and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game—and, subsequently,
Pac-Man derivatives—became a social phenomenon that sold a bevy of merchandise and also inspired,
among other things
an animated television series and a top-ten hit single.

-=[Gameplay]=-

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots.
When all dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage,
between some stages one of three intermission animations plays.
Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man.
If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost.
When all lives have been lost, the game ends.
Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default—DIP
switches inside the machine can change the required points or disable the bonus life altogether.
Near the corners of the maze are four larger,
flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies.
The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly.
When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color.
Blue enemies flash white before they become dangerous
again and the amount of time the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next,
but the time period generally becomes shorter as the game progresses.
In later stages, the enemies do not change colors at all,
but still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten.
